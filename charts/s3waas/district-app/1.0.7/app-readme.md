# district

[district](https://s3waas.gov.in/) is one of the most versatile content management systems for districts to build websites.

This chart bootstraps a [district Application](http://10.247.39.18/s3waas/application) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager. The chart also packages the [Bitnami MariaDB chart](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/tree/master/stable/mariadb) to provide the backend database for the district application.
